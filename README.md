# Project Music Releases
The assignment is to create a responsive new release music list. This will be done with the newest release data provided to us from spotify API.

# The problem
The work started with planning the components. When the repository was cloned the first task was to explore the available data and then plan the components from that. When I create a new repository I like clear and simple organizing. That is how I planned and named all components. If I had more time I would have liked to create different filters and searchable fields for the music. I would also liked to create some type of menu or clickable header.
